**Solution for Exercise 1: Hand-Crafted Network**

### Problem Statement:

We are tasked with designing a neural network to classify a dataset with three classes (red minus, blue plus, green circle) using zero training error. The first step involves constructing single neurons with specified weights, biases, and activation functions to perform specific logical operations. Subsequently, these neurons will form part of a three-layer network.

### Part 1: Single Neurons

#### Logical OR
- **Activation Function:** Heaviside step function.
- **Weights:** Each input \( z_j \) has a weight of 1.
- **Bias:** 0.
- **Function:** \( f(z) = 1 \) if any \( z_j = 1 \); otherwise, \( f(z) = 0 \).

#### Masked Logical OR
- **Activation Function:** Heaviside step function.
- **Weights:** Each input \( z_j \) has a weight corresponding to \( c_j \) (1 if \( c_j = 1 \), 0 otherwise).
- **Bias:** 0.
- **Function:** \( g(z; c) = 1 \) if any \( z_j = 1 \) for which \( c_j = 1 \); otherwise, \( g(z; c) = 0 \).

#### Perfect Match
- **Activation Function:** Heaviside step function.
- **Weights:** Each input \( z_j \) has a weight that is high if \( c_j = 1 \) and very negative otherwise.
- **Bias:** -Sum of weights + 1.
- **Function:** \( h(z; c) = 1 \) if \( z = c \); otherwise, \( h(z; c) = 0 \).

### Part 2: Three-Layer Network Design

#### First Layer
- **Objective:** Map each input vector \( X_i \) onto one corner of a hypercube {0, 1}^M, ensuring all points in one corner belong to the same class.
- **Approach:** Use decision boundaries determined by the single neurons constructed in Part 1. Each decision boundary segregates the inputs based on their classes.
- **Hypercube Mapping:** Assign each class a unique combination of the outputs from the first layer neurons.

#### Second and Third Layers
- **Objective:** Produce a one-hot encoding of the class labels.
- **Second Layer:** Sum up the outputs from the first layer and transform them into a format suitable for one-hot encoding.
- **Third Layer (Output):** Use a set of neurons that act as logical AND functions, ensuring each class outputs its respective one-hot encoded vector.

#### Potential Problems with Zero Training Loss Classifier
- **Overfitting:** Perfect classification on the training set might not generalize well to unseen data.
- **Complexity:** The network might become unnecessarily complex to achieve zero training error, especially with more input dimensions or diverse class distributions.

#### Generalization to Arbitrary Dimensions
- **Feasibility:** As the number of dimensions increases, the network would need exponentially more neurons and layers to maintain zero training error, which may not be computationally feasible.
- **Adaptability:** The networkâ€™s design needs to adapt based on the dataset's characteristics, such as the number of classes and the distribution of data points.
